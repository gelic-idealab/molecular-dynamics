## Learn to use Komodo in Spectator-only Mode

### Learn keyboard movement controls
1. Use `W / A / S / D` to strafe (move forward, left, back, right)
1. Use `Q / E` to rotate left / right
2. Use `2 / 3` to rotate up / down
   
### Learn mouse movement controls
1. Drag the middle mouse button to pan up / down / left / right
1. Scroll in the window to quickly move forward / back

### Learn limitations of spectator-only mode
   
1. The following actions are unimplemented:
     1. Moving a model
     1. Scaling a model
     1. Drawing
     1. Erasing
1. Keep in mind that locking, unlocking, hiding, and showing models is synchronized for everyone.

## Footnotes

[1]: due to a bug in v0.4.1, you will need to teleport twice before doing any height calibration to land at the correct height. Our apologies. 

[2]: If you can't move an unlocked model, it might be because it is inside a locked model. This is a known issue. A recommended workaround is to hide the locked model, moved the unlocked model, and then show the locked model again. Our apologies.
